# Reactive Resume

### [Go to App](https://rxresu.me/) | [Sample Resume](https://google.com/)

Reactive Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume? It‚Äôs as easy as editing 3 values and you‚Äôre done. You don‚Äôt need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.

## Build from Source

1. Clone the repository locally, or use GitHub Codespaces or CodeSandbox

```
git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git
cd Reactive-Resume
```

2. I prefer to use `npm`, but you can use anything to install dependencies (`pnpm`/`yarn`)

```
npm install
```

3. Copy the .env.example files to .env in multiple locations and fill it with values according to your setup

```
cp .env.example .env
cp apps/client/.env.example apps/client/.env
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
```

4. Use Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL instance and a `reactive_resume` database, or feel free to use your own and modify the variables used in `.env`

```
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Run the project and start building!

```
npm start
