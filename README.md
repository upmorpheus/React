## I'd like to donate, how do I do that?

I've been getting close to my limit on hosting at Firebase and I would like to sustain this for as long as possible. Please sponsor the project, as little as possible, so that it would keep the website running. Please reach out to me on my email (given below) if you would like to donate.

## What's so special about it?

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Secure** | It is entirely secure, as in, your information never leaves the browser, powered by web technologies (HTML5 Local Storage API) that allow for data to be stored locally and quickly. |
| **Offline** | The app is a PWA and also has no connection to any servers, thus keeping it entirely offline. It survives refreshes, disconnections, and can also be exported or imported through JSON. |
| **Customizable** | Choose your fonts, play with the colors, pick any layout by merely enabling/disabling sections. A simple and easy to use interface that helps you get a resume in no time! |
| **Templates** | I've been continuously designing new templates and will be releasing new ones as I have the time. Please support development by using the app and leaving a like/comment or sharing it with your peers. |
| **Portable** | Your information can be exported to JSON and imported back into the application from anywhere, all you need is your JSON file. This feature makes it easy to update your resume, upload your file (or have it preloaded from local storage), edit the resume and download it again or print it as PDF. |
| **Minimalistic Design** | As a designer, I felt I had to put this over the top of all other features. Built with minimalism and minimal interaction in mind, it looks clean, is simple to use, and I only hope to make the process more streamlined through your inputs and feedback. |
| **Progressive Web App** | The web app is responsive, which means you can edit your resume on your phone as well and even install it as an app if you're on Android/Chrome. The app is quick to load and would also work if your internet is disconnected. |
| **No Ads, Open Source, and Free** | As with all my projects, I made the app only to help others, so it will always remain free, and I would not be monetizing on it at any point. But if you do feel generous, I'm open to donations :) |

## How can I contribute?

Right now, I don't have many avenues for quick and easy contribution. If you are well versed in React + Tailwind CSS, you can design a few templates yourself. Otherwise, the best way you can contribute is to **star the repository**, **share the app with your friends**, and if possible, **leave some feedback on the app** so that I can better improve it.

## How do I run the project source?

I'm glad you asked :) Here is a step-by-step procedure on getting you started with installation and deployment of the application.

1. Download & Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/), make sure you can run `npm` in the command line
2. `git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git`
3. `cd Reactive-Resume`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm start` - to start the development server
5. `npm run build` - to build a production version of the app

## How do I deploy the project myself

One way is to use the following ["Deploy to Netlify" button](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/11/29/introducing-the-deploy-to-netlify-button/)

- Added Entry Animation to App

- Updated Templates
- Added Nunito Font
- Fixed [Issue #2](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume/issues/2)

## Why did you make this free?

A lot of people have asked me for help in designing their resumes as I have made mine. I just wanted a more natural way to generate resumes and have it easy to update cause updating a resume is always the uphill task. Once I thought of the idea, it was only a matter of time to design and develop the app. I am a big supporter of the open-source development movement as I have been directly benefitted by so many other projects that developers have shared. So needless to say, this project is entirely open-source and free as well :)

Hope you enjoyed using the app, please let me know if you found it helpful.
