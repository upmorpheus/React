# Reactive Resume

![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/amruthpillai/reactive-resume?style=flat-square)

## [Go to App](https://beta.rxresu.me/)

Reactive Resume is a free and open source resume builder that‚Äôs built to make the mundane tasks of creating, updating and sharing your resume as easy as 1, 2, 3. With this app, you can create multiple resumes, share them with recruiters through a unique link and print as PDF, all for free, no advertisements, without losing the integrity and privacy of your data.

You have complete control over what goes into your resume, how it looks, what colors, what templates, even the layout in which sections placed. Want a dark mode resume? It‚Äôs as easy as editing 3 values and you‚Äôre done. You don‚Äôt need to wait to see your changes either. Everything you type, everything you change, appears immediately on your resume and gets updated in real time.

## Docker Setup

You can pull the prebuilt docker images right off the shelf from either [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/amruthpillai/reactive-resume) or [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/amruthpillai/reactive-resume). Keep in mind, you would also need a database for this to work as intended.

```sh
# Server
docker run -p 3100:3100 --env-file .env amruthpillai/reactive-resume:server-latest

# Client
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env amruthpillai/reactive-resume:client-latest
```

Or, to make your life easier there's a simple `docker-compose.yml` included to help you get set up for success.

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Build from Source

If you don't want to use Docker, I understand. There's an old-school way to build the app too. This project, and these instructions rely heavily on [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) so you might want to have that installed on your system before you continue.

1. Clone the repository locally, or use GitHub Codespaces or CodeSandbox

```
git clone https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git
cd Reactive-Resume
```

2. Install dependencies using `pnpm`, but feel free to use any other package manager that supports npm workspaces.

```
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root and fill it with values according to your setup. You can skip the SendGrid variables if you don't want to set up mail right away.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

1. Use Docker Compose to create a PostgreSQL instance and a `reactive_resume` database, or feel free to use your own and modify the variables used in `.env`

```
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

5. Run the project and start building!

```
pnpm dev
```
