# Source Code

No, I'm not going to be talking about [the 2011 movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/) here.

The source code to Reactive Resume is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmruthPillai) for you to poke, prod, pull and publish. It is distributed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) which allows you to do **anything you want** with it, including commercial use.

In this section, I'll be going through the steps on how you can build the project on your local machine (or the cloud). You can choose one of two paths from here:

- [Docker](/source-code/docker)
- [Local Build](/source-code/local-build)
