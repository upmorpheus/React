# Local Build

This might not be the most versatile, but it's quite easy and my recommended way of getting the project set up. This project is heavily dependent on [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) and it's monorepo workspaces feature, so I'd pick that up if I were you.

1. Once you have `pnpm` set up, you can pull the source code from GitHub and dive into the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume.git
cd Reactive-Resume
```

2. Install dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and it should take just a few minutes.

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project root and fill it with values according to your setup. To know which environment variables are required, and about what they do, head over [this section](env-vars).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run the app locally by using the command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now, your **frontend** client should be running on [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000), your **backend** server on [`http://localhost:3100`](http://localhost:3100) and this **documentation** on [`http://localhost:3200`](http://localhost:3200).

5. Build the project before deploying by running the command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

6. Finally, start the production servers for all three workspaces by running:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Additionally, you can check the `package.json` for some additional scripts on how to run commands for a specific workspace. For more information on pnpm workspaces, head over to [their documentation](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).
